This Software Agreement ("Agreement") is between You (either an individual or an entity), the End User, and Sony Mobile Communications Inc. ("Sony"). The Agreement authorizes You to use the Software specified in Clause 1 below, which may be stored on a CD-ROM, sent to You by electronic mail, or downloaded from Sony's Web pages or Servers or from other sources under the terms and conditions set forth below. This is an agreement on end-user rights and not an agreement for sale. Except as provided elsewhere in this Agreement, Sony and/or its licensors continues to own the copy of the Software and the physical media contained in the sales package and any other copy that You are authorized to make pursuant to this Agreement.
Read this Agreement carefully before installing, downloading, or using the Software. By clicking on the "I Accept" button while installing, downloading, and/or using the Software, You agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If You do not agree to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, promptly click the "Decline" or "I Do Not Accept" button, cancel the installation or downloading, or destroy or return the Software and accompanying documentation to Sony. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. SOFTWARE.

As used in this Agreement, the term "Software" means, collectively: (i) all the contents of the disk(s), CD-ROM(s), electronic mail and its file attachments, or other media with which this Agreement is provided, including the object code form of the software delivered via a CD-ROM, electronic mail, or Web page (ii) digital images, stock photographs, clip art, or other artistic works ("Stock Files") (iii) related explanatory written materials and any other possible documentation related thereto ("Documentation"); (iv) fonts, and (v) upgrades, modified versions, updates, additions, and copies of the Software (collectively "Updates"), if any, licensed to You by Sony under this Agreement.

2. END USER RIGHTS AND USE.

Sony grants You non-exclusive, non-transferable end-user rights to install the Software on the local hard disk(s) or other permanent storage media of one computer and use the Software on a single computer or terminal at a time. Except as provided by any Open Source License Terms, You may use the Software only for the sole purpose of testing and developing Your own applications and/or content.
You acknowledge that certain software components of the Software ("Open Source Components") may be covered by so-called "Open Source License Terms". As used herein, Open Source License Terms means any software licenses approved as open source licenses by the Open Source Initiative or any substantially similar licenses, including without limitation any license that, as a condition of use, modification, or distribution of the software licensed under such license or other software incorporated into, derived from or distributed with such software, requires that the distributor: (a) make the software available in source code format; (b) grant permission for creation of derivative works; or (c) grant a royalty free license thereto or under any associated intellectual property rights. To the extent required by the licenses covering Open Source Components, the terms of such licenses will apply in lieu of the terms of this Agreement. To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to Open Source Components prohibit any of the restrictions in this Agreement with respect to such Open Source Component, such restrictions will not apply to such Open Source Component. To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to Open Source Components require Sony to provide source code for such Open Source Component to You, Sony shall do so upon Your request. To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to Open Source Components require Sony to make an offer to provide source code for such Open Source Component to You, this provision constitutes such offer. You shall not otherwise cause any portion of the Software to become subject to any license obligation under any Open Source License Terms. For clarity, in the event that all or any portion of the Software provided hereunder does not reference, or otherwise indicate, such Open Source License Terms, this Agreement shall control. Please see "Settings/About phone/Legal information/Open source license" when running the emulator to review the complete list of Open Source Components, Copyright holders, and applicable Open Source License Terms. Sony offers to provide source code of software licensed under the GPL or LGPL or some other open source licenses allowing source code distribution to you on a CD-ROM for a charge covering the cost of performing such distribution, such as the cost of media, shipping and handling, upon written request to Sony Mobile Communications AB, Open Source Software Operations, Nya Vattentornet, SE-221 88 Lund, Sweden. This offer is valid for a period of three (3) years from the date of the distribution of this product by Sony. As an alternative to the above "written request", you can download the same source code from http://opensource.sonymobile.com.
Sony collects anonymous usage data to help us make this product better. The data we collect contains information about the device model and the number of times an application is launched. Once sent to Sony, the data is stored in aggregated form and made available to Sony employees.

3. LIMITATIONS ON END USER RIGHTS.

Unless a Third Party License provides otherwise as to a particular portion of the Software, You may not copy, distribute, or make derivative works of the Software except as follows:
(a) You may make one copy of the Software on magnetic media as an archival backup copy, provided Your archival backup copy is not installed or used on any computer. Any other copies You make of the Software are in violation of this Agreement.

You should review the "Readme" files associated with the Stock Files that You use to ascertain what rights You have with respect to such materials. Stock Files may not be used in the production of libelous, defamatory, fraudulent, infringing, lewd, obscene, or pornographic material or in any otherwise illegal manner. You may not register or claim any rights in the Stock Files or derivative works thereof.
(f) You agree that You shall only use the Software in a manner that complies with all applicable laws, including, but not limited to, applicable restrictions concerning copyright and other intellectual property rights.Â  Likewise, You shall not develop any application or other software using the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy.
Where a Third Party License provides additional rights to copy, distribute, or make derivative works of a particular portion of the Software, those additional rights apply only to such portion, and to no other.

After such time You no longer have a right to use the previous version, except for the sole purpose of enabling You to install the Update. The foregoing limitations in this clause 5 may not apply to portions of the Software covered by Open Source License Terms.

6. COMMENCEMENT &amp; TERMINATION.

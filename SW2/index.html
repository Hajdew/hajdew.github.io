    I want to make an app for SW2 so i need to recreate some SDK's to be able to create one
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160220044733/https://developer.sony.com/2013/09/25/how-to-create-an-app-extension-for-sony-smartwatch-2/">i want to make this work</a>

    <p>I have 2/3 files for make it work but one of those files have to connect with sony servers to download some things or just for a verification.</p><br>
    <p>All sony pages are down so they probably will have be recreated too</p>
